.TH CHD 1 "Nov 2017" "character hex dump"
.LO 1
.SH NAME
chd \- character-oriented hex dump
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chd
[OPTIONS] [FILE ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chd
generates a dump of the characters making up the input file(s),
similar to
.BR xxd (1)
but Unicode-aware.
.SH OPTIONS
If no input file is given, or is specified as "\fB-\fR", then
.B chd
reads from standard input.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-count\fR=\fIN\fR
Set the number of characters to display per line of output to
.IR N .
The default is 8.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\fR
By default,
.B chd
will stop reading an input file if an invalid sequence of bytes is
encountered. With this option, the invalid sequence will be handled as
uninterpreted raw bytes. Such bytes are marked in the output with an
prefixed asterisk. (Be aware that, with some character encodings,
there is no guarantee that continuing to read input after an invalid
sequence will produce sensible output.)
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR=\fIN\fR
Stop reading input after
.I N
characters.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB--reverse\fR
Reverse operation: read the input file as a dump file generated by
.B chd
and output the sequence of characters that would produce that dump.
Note that only the hexadecimal values are read; everything on the
input line following these are ignored. For best results, include the
.B \-\-count
option if the dump being parsed used a different number of
characters per line than the default.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-start\fR=\fIN\fR
Start after
.I N
characters of input, skipping over any previous characters.
.TP
.B \--help
Display help and exit.
.TP
.B \--version
Display version information and exit.
