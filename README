  About This Program

This program produces a dump of its input file, similar to a hexdump,
but displaying the output as Unicode codepoints instead of raw bytes.

The source code also provides a very simple example of using C's
wide-character library functions to handle Unicode I/O without
explicitly hard-coding UTF-8 encoding sequences.

  Building and Installing

There is no configure script. To build, simply run "make". The
existing executable runs standalone. To install, run "make install".
By default the makefile installs chd under /usr/local, but you can
override this by changing the value of the PREFIX variable.
