  About This Program

This program produces a dump of its input file, similar to a hexdump,
but displaying the output as Unicode codepoints instead of raw bytes.

The source code also provides a very simple example of using C's
wide-character library functions to handle Unicode I/O without
explicitly hard-coding UTF-8 encoding sequences.
